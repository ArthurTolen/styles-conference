Hey there!

Welcome to the Styles Conference website.

I fully rebuilt the Styles Conference webpages as a coding practice exercise.
Writing this code allowed me to assimilate and apply some of the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS.

This website is complete and fully functional.






Thanks for stopping by!
